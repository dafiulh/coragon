## To-do

- **custom repeat**, the `repeat` field will contain an array with 2 elements, like for example `[3, "week"]`, means repeat event every 3 weeks
- **repeated event can be snoozed**, create a field named `original_date` or something, which contains original date before event is snoozed

## Create your own

I'm too lazy for this :p

Coming soon ...
