## Todo

- **custom repeat**, the `repeat` field will contain an array with 2 elements, like for example `[3, "week"]`, means repeat event every 3 weeks
- **repeated event can be snoozed**, create a new field named `original_date`, which contains original date before event is snoozed

## Quick start

I'm too lazy for this :p
